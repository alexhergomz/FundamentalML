# FundamentalML

A collection of fundamental machine learning projects implemented in PyTorch, featuring detailed implementations and comparisons of various architectures. Each project includes comprehensive Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations and visualizations.

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. MNIST VAE Comparison (MLP vs CNN)
Compare two Variational Autoencoder implementations:
- Fully-connected (MLP) architecture
- Convolutional (CNN) architecture
- Side-by-side performance analysis

### 2. DCGAN Implementation
A PyTorch implementation of Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN):
- Generator and Discriminator architecture following the original paper
- Training on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Visualization for generated samples
- Latent space interpolation

### 3. Conditional Models Comparison (cVAE vs cGAN)
Comparison of two conditional generative models:
- Conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE)
- Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
- Class-conditional generation
- Performance metrics and visualizations

## üìä Features

- Complete PyTorch implementations
